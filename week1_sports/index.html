        <h1 style="color: #9f5307;">Game Overview</h1>
        <p>Badminton is a racquet sport played using racquets to hit a shuttlecock across a net.It is played on a rectangular court divided
             into halves by a net.
             Points are scored when the shuttlecock lands within the opponent's court boundaries.The match begins with a serve,
             where one player hits the shuttlecock to the opponent's court.
             The serve alternates between players or teams after each point is scored.</p>
             <h3 style="color: #edaa26;">History</h3>
             <p>The game of badminton is believed to have originated in ancient civilizations in Europe and Asia, with roots tracing back to games played 
                in ancient Greece, China, and India. The modern version of badminton, however, developed in British India in the mid-19th century.
                Badminton evolved from a game called "battledore and shuttlecock" which was played 
                 using rudimentary equipment similar to modern rackets and shuttlecocks.The modern rules of badminton were formalized in the early 20th century,
                  with the Badminton Association of England being established in 1893 to standardize the game.
                  Badminton gained popularity globally throughout the 20th century and became an Olympic sport in 1992 at the Barcelona Summer Olympics. </p>
